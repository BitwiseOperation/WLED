Contains a modification to use WLED in combination with a Hard Drive LED Clock similar as built in [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Hard-Drive-NeoPixel-3D-Printed-Clock/).

## Installation 

To install this Usermod, you instruct PlatformIO to compile the Project with the USERMOD_HARD_DRIVE_CLOCK flag.
WLED then automatically provides you with various settings on the Usermod Page.    
Please make sure your WLED Time is set to 12 hour mode.
